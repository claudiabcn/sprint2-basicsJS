⚡️ SPRINT 2: Part 1/2 - Basic Javascript Exercises

🔗 Project Repository:
https://github.com/claudiabcn/sprint2-basicsJS Branch: 2.1-Level2-Excercises

🎯 Objectives:
Arrow Functions & Loops: Put arrow functions in loops.

Ternary Operator (Advanced): Use tricky nested ternaries and put them inside loops.

Callbacks (Async): Use callbacks for delayed actions (setTimeout).

Rest & Spread (Objects): Use Spread (...) to easily clone/merge objects without changing the originals.

Array Chaining: Line up filter, map, reduce all on one line.

Object Loops: Loop through object properties (for...in) and use break to stop loops.

Async/Await: Use async/await to make asynchronous code much simpler.

💻 Technology:
JavaScript
