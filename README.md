# ⚡️ SPRINT 2: Part 1/2 - Basic Javascript Exercises

This project is part of Sprint 2 and focuses on solidifying key concepts in modern JavaScript, with an emphasis on advanced asynchronicity and professional data/collection handling.

Here are the exercises of **Level 2**.

**Branch**: 2.1-Level2-Excercises

## 🎯 Objectives

### Arrow Functions & Loops
Put arrow functions in loops.

### Ternary Operator (Advanced)
Use tricky nested ternaries and put them inside loops.

### Callbacks (Async)
Use callbacks for delayed actions (`setTimeout`).

### Rest & Spread (Objects)
Use Spread (`...`) to easily clone/merge objects without changing the originals.

### Array Chaining
Line up `filter`, `map`, `reduce` all on one line.

### Object Loops
Loop through object properties (`for...in`) and use `break` to stop loops.

### Async/Await
Use `async`/`await` to make asynchronous code much simpler.

## ⭐ Learnings and Challenges Encountered

Among the challenges encountered, I can mention:

- Build complex logic using nested ternaries.
- Master immutable object copying with Spread.
- Handle asynchronous flow using callbacks and `async`/`await`.
- Optimize arrays by chaining methods.
