# ⚡️ SPRINT 2: Part 1/2 - Basic Javascript Exercises

This project is part of Sprint 2 and focuses on solidifying key concepts in modern JavaScript, with an emphasis on advanced asynchronicity and professional data/collection handling.

Here are the exercises of **Level 1**.

**Branch**: 2.1-Level1-Excercises

## 🎯 Objectives

- Arrow Functions: Understand the concise syntax and the use of `this`.

- Ternary Operator: Replace simple if/else statements with more compact code.

- Callbacks (Sync): Use callbacks for basic flow control.

- Rest & Spread (Arrays): Merge arrays (Spread) and collect arguments (Rest).

- Array Methods: Master the big four: `map`, `filter`, `find`, and `reduce`.

- Loops: Use `forEach` and `for...of` to iterate over arrays.

- Promises: Create promises and use them with `.then()`.

## ⭐ Learnings and Challenges Encountered

Among the challenges encountered, I can mention:

- Mastery of modern arrow function syntax.
- Writing super compact conditional code (Ternary).
- Handling data collections with Array transformations.
- Understanding the foundation of Asynchronicity with Promises.
