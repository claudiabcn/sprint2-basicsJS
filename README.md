# ⚡️ SPRINT 2: Part 1/2 - Basic Javascript Exercises

This project is part of Sprint 2 and focuses on solidifying key concepts in modern JavaScript, with an emphasis on advanced asynchronicity and professional data/collection handling.

Here are the exercises of **Level 3**.

**Branch**: 2.1-Level3-Excercises

## 🎯 Objectives

The exercises cover the following topics:

- Complex Asynchronicity: Manage multiple promises simultaneously using `Promise.all`.

- Error Handling (Async): Use `try`/`catch` within `async`/`await` functions to prevent code from crashing.

- Callbacks (Data): Apply callbacks to transform data (e.g., converting text to uppercase).

- Rest & Spread: Use Spread (`...`) to pass an array as arguments to a function and use Rest (`...`) in Destructuring.

- Array Validation: Use `every` and `some` to validate entire collections.

- Loops (Index): Iterate over arrays obtaining both the value and the position (index).

## ⭐ Learnings and Challenges Encountered

During this sprint, the ability to:

- Execute asynchronous code in parallel (`Promise.all`).
- Write fault-tolerant code with robust asynchronous error handling.
- Master advanced techniques for validating collections (`every`/`some`).
- Expertly use Rest and Spread in destructuring and function arguments.
