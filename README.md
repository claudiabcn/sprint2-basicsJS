⚡️ SPRINT 2: Part 1/2 - Basic Javascript Exercises
This project is part of Sprint 2 and focuses on solidifying key concepts in modern JavaScript, with an emphasis on advanced asynchronicity and professional data/collection handling.
Here there are the excercises of level 3.

🔗 Project Resources
Repository: https://github.com/claudiabcn/sprint2-basicsJS

Branch: 2.1-Level3-Excercises

🎯 Objectives
The exercises cover the following topics:

Complex Asynchronicity: Manage multiple promises simultaneously using Promise.all.

Error Handling (Async): Use try/catch within async/await functions to prevent code from crashing.

Callbacks (Data): Apply callbacks to transform data (e.g., converting text to uppercase).

Rest & Spread (Pro):

Use Spread (...) to pass an array as arguments to a function.

Use Rest (...) in Destructuring.

Array Validation: Use every and some to validate entire collections.

Loops (Index): Iterate over arrays obtaining both the value and the position (index).

⭐ Learnings and Challenges Encountered

During this sprint, the ability to:

Execute asynchronous code in parallel (Promise.all).

Write fault-tolerant code with robust asynchronous error handling.

Master advanced techniques for validating collections (every/some).

Expertly use Rest and Spread in destructuring and function arguments.
