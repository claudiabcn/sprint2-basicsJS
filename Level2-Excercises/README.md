This project is part of Sprint 2 and focuses on solidifying key concepts in modern JavaScript, with an emphasis on advanced asynchronicity and professional data/collection handling.

Here are the exercises of **Level 2**.


## 🎯 Objectives

     -Arrow functions
     -Ternary operator
     -Callbacks
     -Rest and Spread operators
     -Array methods (map, filter, forEach, etc.)

## ⭐ Learnings and Challenges Encountered

Among the challenges encountered, I can mention:
