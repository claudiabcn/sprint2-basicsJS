# ⚡️ SPRINT 2: Part 1/2 - Basic Javascript Exercises

This project is part of Sprint 2 and focuses on solidifying key concepts in modern JavaScript, with an emphasis on advanced asynchronicity and professional data/collection handling.

Here are the exercises of **Level 2**.

## 🔗 Project Repository

**Repository**: [https://github.com/claudiabcn/sprint2-basicsJS](https://github.com/claudiabcn/sprint2-basicsJS)  
**Branch**: 2.1-Level2-Excercises

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Arrow Functions & Loops: Put arrow functions in loops.

- Ternary Operator (Advanced): Use tricky nested ternaries and put them inside loops.

- Callbacks (Async): Use callbacks for delayed actions (`setTimeout`).

- Rest & Spread (Objects): Use Spread (`...`) to easily clone/merge objects without changing the originals.

- Array Chaining: Line up `filter`, `map`, `reduce` all on one line.

- Object Loops: Loop through object properties (`for...in`) and use `break` to stop loops.

- Async/Await: Use `async`/`await` to make asynchronous code much simpler.

## ⭐ Learnings and Challenges Encountered

Among the challenges encountered, I can mention:

- Build complex logic using nested ternaries.
- Master immutable object copying with Spread.
- Handle asynchronous flow using callbacks and `async`/`await`.
- Optimize arrays by chaining methods.
